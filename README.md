This repository contains a simple AutoLISP routine for AutoCAD Korean
environment. Load `profileedit.lsp` in AutoCAD to use the `PROFILEEDIT`
command. The command adjusts a line based on nearby numeric text and
rotates any text near the endpoints or the line's midpoint to align with
the updated slope.
