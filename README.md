## Automatic Street Inlet Placement

This project includes an AutoCAD LISP script `streetinlet_install.lsp`.
Run the **STINLET** command to automatically insert the block named
"Street inlet" along a selected pipe at user-defined spacing. The script
also allows optional guide lines between the pipe and the road edges.
